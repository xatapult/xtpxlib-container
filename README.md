# `xtpxlib-container`: Xatapult XML Library - Support for XML containers (multiple files wrapped into one)

**Xatapult Content Engineering - [`http://www.xatapult.com`](http://www.xatapult.com)**

---------- 

XML Containers provide support for working with multiple related files by wrapping them into a single one. 
Binary files are referenced instead of included. 

The container structure is standardized. Once contents is in a container it's easy to analyze, change and/or write back. 
It can also be used to create a whole file structure, in a container, and then write it out to disk or zip file.

The `xtpxlib-container` component has XProc (1.0) pipelines for:
* Reading the contents of a zip file or directory structure into a container
* Writing a container out to a zip file or disk
